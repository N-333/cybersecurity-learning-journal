## Role of a Security Analyst  
- Understands and monitors security events to detect and respond to potential threats.  
- Protects organizational assets by implementing preventive and corrective controls.  
- Communicates incidents effectively and contributes to improving defense mechanisms.

---

## Cyber Attacks and Threat Actors  
- Studied various cyber attack types, including:  
  - Phishing and spear-phishing  
  - Malware and ransomware  
  - Social engineering attacks  
  - Denial-of-Service (DoS) and insider threats  
- Reviewed historical malware and early viruses to understand how modern attacks evolved.  
- Learned about different threat actors such as script kiddies, hacktivists, cybercriminals, nation-states, and insider threats, along with their motivations and techniques.

## Security Frameworks and Regulations  
Gained an understanding of major frameworks and regulations that guide security operations, including:  
- NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework): A structured approach for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from threats.  
- NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework): Framework for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks.  
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): European law for protecting personal data and privacy.  
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): U.S. regulation that safeguards health information.  

These frameworks emphasize compliance, risk management, and maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.

## Security Ethics  
- Explored the ethical principles guiding cybersecurity professionals, including confidentiality, integrity, accountability, and transparency.  
- Learned how ethical decision-making impacts cybersecurity operations, particularly when balancing user privacy with system monitoring.  
- Recognized that ethical conduct and trust are foundational to every cybersecurity role.

## Reflection  
This module provided a strong foundation in cybersecurity fundamentals and clarified how security integrates into an organization’s overall structure.  
Understanding the various frameworks, threat actors, and attack types gave me a broader perspective on how to approach security both technically and ethically.  
Moving forward, I plan to strengthen my technical knowledge in network defense and practice using SIEM tools in lab environments.
